This is a repo forked from [shupp/sgp4](https://github.com/shupp/sgp4), which include implementation and validation of SGP4/SDP4 using four languages: C++, Fortran, Java, MATLAB, and Pascal. 

The work is very well organized and the multi-language implementation works as a great cross-validation to each other.

Recently, I just need matlab for my own research, so I decide to prune other languages.
